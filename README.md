# React Crash Course 2021

# Some Information

    - This is just my following along with the react crash course [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8)

# Notes

    - For Production:
        - npm run build
            - react-scripts build
            - creates an assets directory inside of build and this can be used to deploy the app.
